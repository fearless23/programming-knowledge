# UTF-8 encoding

- [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)

UTF-8 is the dominant encoding for the World Wide Web (and internet technologies), accounting for 98.0% of all web pages, over 99.0% of the top 10,000 pages, and up to 100% for many languages, as of 2023. Virtually all countries and languages have 95% or more use of UTF-8 encodings on the web.

- UTF include so many languages along with english and their characters like hindi, chinese etc.
- Graphenes are print-able blocks to represent letter in other languages, other languages can have half-letters, letters on top of letter like bindi in hindi, or hat over A in french etc. Thus. graphene represent those variations as letters.


- UTF-8 is represented by one to four bytes(=8bit), i.e in can have minimum 1 byte(8bits) or max 4 bytes(32bits)
- The first byte of utf-8 also represent ASCII, thus UTF-8 is backward compatible with ASCII
- Any ASCII encodes string will display exactly same in UTF-8 as well


## How many characters/graphenes
Unicode comprises 1,114,112 code points in the range 0hex to 10FFFFhex. The Unicode code space is divided into seventeen planes (the basic multilingual plane, and 16 supplementary planes), each with 65,536 (= 216) code points. Thus the total size of the Unicode code space is 17 Ã— 65,536 = 1,114,112.
