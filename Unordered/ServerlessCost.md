## Serverless cost

Serverless cost formula

Use this over-simplified formula

- Service1
  - Traditional: $12 per day -> $360 per month [~$0.5 per hour]
  - Serverless: $0.75 per hour ->

Serverless price is higher than average hourly price of traditional method.
- If your service is run 24 hours in a day: 
  - cost of traditional = $12
  - cost of Serverless = $18
- If your service is run 12 hours in a day:
  - cost of traditional = $12
  - cost of Serverless = $9
- If your service is run 4 hours in a day:
  - cost of traditional = $12
  - cost of Serverless = $3

So, 
- Traditional cost are fixed but if we get spike of requests it might fail.
- serverless per hour is costlier but if service do not run at full capacity it will drastically lower cost.
